# Introduction

The research primarily aims to provide readers with a clear understanding of the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns in curbing the spread of the Coronavirus across various states in the United States. Despite numerous questions and widespread misinformation regarding the efficacy of vaccinations, their effectiveness against emerging variants, and the likelihood of reinfection post-vaccination, this study seeks to clarify the impact vaccinations have had on the pandemic thus far. By doing so, it may dispel some of the misconceptions about COVID-19 vaccinations and encourage individuals to seek reliable information. The following sections will address several key issues related to vaccination discussed in this research.
1. What are the vaccination trends in different states across the United States?
2. What are the 5 states with the Highest vaccination and least vaccination?
3. What is the percentage of people who are vaccinated in the total vaccines distributed in
different states?
4. What vaccine is more distributed or administered (Moderna/Pfizer/Johnson-Johnson) in
different states of the US? What is the most distributed vaccine in the United States?
5. Exploring Country-wise distribution of COVID-19 vaccines.


## Methodology
### Exploratory data analysis:

Exploratory data analysis is the method used to explore the data, identify patterns in the data, visualize the data and use the data for modelling, identify underlying features in the data and find the relationship between the datasets. The data collected from different sources need to be imported and merged if necessary to visualize the information present in the data.The tools used for this project are python and PowerBI.The datasets are collected from the reliable and official sources like Kaggle, CDC, California Health, and Human Services Open Data Portal, Data.gov.

Python libraries like pandas, NumPy, seaborn, matplotlib are used to perform Exploratory data analysis on the datasets collected. PowerBI provides all the tools and graphs to create different types of visuals which helps in efficient communication of data. PowerBI extracts data from different formats of data such as Excel, CSV, web etc. The extracted data can be transformed by the ETL process which makes the data more understandable and in return makes the visuals efficient. The visuals combined with EDA provide an efficient way to analyze the information and underlying data. However, both the simple and complex ideas must be communicating with clarity, precision and efficiency.

The first step of any Exploratory Data Analysis is to collect data. graphical excellence principle requires telling truth about the data. So, it is important that the data collected should be good and reliable. The datasets collected from the sources contain many missing/null values, empty values, garbage values. It is important to clean the data before using for modelling or visualization. The datasets after cleaning are as shown in the below figs.

The datasets collected for analysis of the COVID 19 vaccinations in the United States are gathered from different. These datasets are collected from the reliable and official sources like Kaggle, CDC, California Health, and Human Services Open Data Portal, Data.gov. We used various analysis using phython and powerBI dashboard to answer out research questions.
